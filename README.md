# The OpenCms Mercury Template #

## A full-featured, customizable, great looking responsive template for OpenCms ##

The Mercury Template is a complete, modular template for [OpenCms](https://opencms.org). It is based on Bootstrap 5 and allows you to create simple or advanced grid layouts with drag & drop. It packs a ton of CSS features and JavaScript plugins that have been carefully integrated to be easy to use for the content manager. And it ships with all the Java and SASS sources so you can fully customize it to your unique requirements.

For the technical minded here are some more background facts about Mercury:

* **SASS sources** CSS gurus can style the complete HTML output with individual CSS-themes using Mercurys [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) infrastructure.
* **All minified** Mercurys npm build process minifies all CSS and JavaScript to give website visitors the best page loading performance.
* **Source maps provided** Mercury provides full CSS and JavaScript source maps so you can see the original sources in the Chrome or Firefox developer tools.

**A demo website for the Mercury template is shipped as part of the main [OpenCms](https://opencms.org) download.**

## Customizing Mercury from source ##

The rest of this page deals explains the technical process of how to customize the template from source. This is required only if you require full control of all aspects of the HTML / CSS being generated.

### Structure of the repository source files ###

The Mercury template source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alkacon/mercury-template).

This repository contains all the Mercury functionality shipped with the demo.

The template's static resources, i.e., CSS, JavaScript, fonts and images are all bundled in the module *alkacon.mercury.theme*. Here you find all CSS and JavaScript used by Mercury in minified CSS and JavaScript files.

Java sources are located in the folders starting with `./alkacon.mercury`. The structure of these folders is required by OpenCms.

The CSS themes are generated from the resources under `./template-src/scss`.

The JavaScript is generated from the resources under `./template-src/js`.

### Building the Mercury CSS and JavaScript ###

To customize the template, you can add or change files under `template-src` and then use SASS / npm to compile the sources and place the results in the *alkacon.mercury.theme* module.

To create Mercurys CSS and JavaScript resources from source, you need to setup a compile environment with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). There are many articles available in the web on the details on how to setup such an environment, so we will provide only some brief details about the process here. We will assume that you have the basic environment already in place here.

You need to check out this repository from GitHub first. Then run

```shell
sudo npm install
```
to install all dependencies required to compile the template's sources.

Once all dependencies are installed, you can trigger the compilation by running

```shell
npm run dist
```
in the repository's root folder.

After running `npm`, the repository will have a new folder `./build/npm/` with three sub-folders. The sub-folder `03_minified/` contains the final CSS resources that you can copy to the *alkacon.mercury.theme* module. The result has to be copied to the folder `/system/modules/alkacon.mercury.theme/`.

You can also set the environment variable `OCMOUNTS` to point to a folder where the compilation result should be copied to. The intention is to mount the VFS of the OpenCms installation you develop on and set `OCMOUNTS` to point to the mount point. Then the CSS and JavaScript sources are updated automatically in the installation and you can see your changes in action.

### Customizing Mercurys CSS ###

Our npm process uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to generate minified CSS files (with source maps).

The Mercury Template uses CSS themes. By default, the themes *theme-blue* and *theme-red* are available.

Our npm process generates one minified CSS file (with source map) for each theme. There is also one additional CSS file generated that contains resources shared by all themes.

To write your own theme, you could add add an `.scss` file in the folder `./template-src/scss-themes/`, e.g., `theme-custom.scss`.

The simplest adjustment to do in your theme is to change the color values of `$main-theme`, `$main-theme-hover` and `$main-theme-additional`, but you can overwrite any of the variables defined in one of the `.scss` files under `./template-src/scss/`. Of course, you can also add your own variables and style definitions.

### Customizing Mercurys JavaScript ###

Our npm process uses Webpack to generate minified JavaScript files (with source maps) that are shared by all generated CSS themes.

The main entry script is called `mercury.js`. Other scripts are either directly included here, or loaded on demand when required on the web page.

You can modify or extend the files found in `./template-src/js` according to your requirements.

### Building the Mercury OpenCms modules ###

Mercurys modules are built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org). The interesting targets are:

* `dist_{module name}` to build a single module (includes building the module's JAR if required)
* `jar_{module name}` to build only a module JAR
* `bindist` to build all modules

The module *alkacon.mercury.template.democontents* contains a complete web site built with the Mercury Template. It serves as demonstration of the various content elements that are part of the template.

The  [OpenCms Documentation](http://documentation.opencms.org) has more details about the general process required to build general OpenCms modules. Here we want to focus on the special way the Mercury CSS / JavaScript sources are build.
