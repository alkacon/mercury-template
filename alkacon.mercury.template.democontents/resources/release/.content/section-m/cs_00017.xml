<p><span class="label label-red">Notice for users of Alkacon OCEE</span> Users of Alkacon OCEE require a new OCEE version for OpenCms 10. The update is free for Alkacon customers with a valid OCEE update subscription. <a href="%(link0)" target="_blank">Please contact Alkacon</a>&nbsp;to receive the new version.</p>
<h3>Compatibility with Java versions, servlet containers and databases</h3>
<p>OpenCms 10.0.0 has been written and tested for Java 8 and Java 7. We have tested with ORACLEs JDK as well as OpenJDK. OpenCms should run with all compliant JVMs.</p>
<p>We have tested this release on the Tomcat servlet engine. OpenCms works "out of the box" with Tomcat 8&nbsp;or 7, which we recommend. Others have reported deploying OpenCms successfully on other servlet containers like JBoss, WildFly, WebLogic, WebSphere, GlassFish and Resin.</p>
<p>On the database side, we have tested with MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, DB2 and HSQLDB.</p>
