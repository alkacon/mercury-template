      <content><![CDATA[<p>With the JSON API introduced in version 12, OpenCms is not only a tool for managing website content but also for managing mobile application content.</p>
<p>Mobile applications typically provide a combination of features and up-to-date information. Areas with information change regularly and contribute to mobile applications being used more often. When content changes in a mobile application, there is not a new version of an application published every time - content is rather updated on a regular basis via content service interfaces such as the OpenCms JSON API.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the JSON API, editorial teams can use the OpenCms backend to create news items for their mobile applications and to publish them on a scheduled basis without the need for an extra mobile editorial system. There are various possibilities available for editorial teams to configure news lists and to decide upon presentation issues.</p>]]></content>
